## Playing around with Prose.io

This is more or less a test of a new program for me.  I'm playing around with a new web based editor for GitHub Pages called [Prose.io](http://prose.io/). The idea is to allow access to my posts via the GitHub API and use the prose.ip editor to create and edit posts directly from the web without having to edit posts locally on a stand alone computer. 
So far the hosted version just seems to work.  I allow access to GitHub via the prose.ip front page, then I create a new post and go to town
