## Playing around with Prose.io

This post is a test of a new program for me.  I'm playing around with a new web based editor for GitHub Pages called [Prose.io](http://prose.io/). The idea is to allow access to my posts via the GitHub API and use the prose.ip editor to create and edit posts directly from the web without having to edit posts locally on a stand alone computer. 
This post is just some inital impressions of prose.io written as I think of them. 
So far the hosted version just seems to work.  I allow access to GitHub via the prose.ip front page, then I create a new post and go to town.  It works well enough although it would be better to prompt for a file name.  I thought I'd set it when I created the post, but it didn't seem take, so I changed the name on a commit of my work and that seemed to work OK.
I do notice that there's no spell check built in to this.  I'm used to having it with my text entry, and I think I'd miss it if I used this full time. There may be a way to turn it on (or back on) but there doesn't seem to be a quick way to do it from the prose web GUI.
