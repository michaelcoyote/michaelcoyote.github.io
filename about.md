# about

I'm Michael I've been on the internet for 30+ years and as of 2025
I've had this particular blog up for about 10 years now which is a very long
time in internet years.  
It's a very ancient Jekyll blog and I've hacked it up to make it sort of work 
for what I want.  I've been blogging very haphazardly for most of my time here,
maybe a post every 6 months to a year. I had various websites before this, but
this was my first "blog" as such.  

This blog started as a place for me to "broadcast" my thoughts, but it's turned
into a parts bin/junk bin of sorts.  I tend to do a lot of barely structured
writing on topics I'm learning and things I've broken and fixed.  
At this point,I think I'm just going to keep leaning into this "parts bin" paradigm and keep 
posting stuff here which may just be a quick note on what I'm doing or reading
on a particular day, but it's possible that it may be useful to other folks.  

I do write a lot of notes when working on projects but almost never post. I
think I'll start posting more of what I write with minimal editing just to see
if it works for people.  Writing for myself is one thing, but writing for others is a different animal
completely, and I think the best way for me to improve is to write a lot more,
and get better at editing it quickly. It seems like the best posts are the ones
I tidy up quickly and push out the door.  I also think that spending ages on a 
post is a recipe for not posting.   

I do collect stats on posts and I can see what gets indexed so I can
see what weird things people are picking up on, but I'll likely just keep
posting my random posts with my [weird sense of humor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goon_Show_running_jokes).

I've not set up any sort of commenting here, but I can be found [on the
Fediverse]({{ site.author.fediverse }}) and I'd love to chat with you there. I
am also occasionally on other social networks but much more rarely.  

I am also available via [email](mailto:{{site.author.email }}) if you'd like to reach
me that way.
