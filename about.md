I'm Michael and as of 2025 I've had this particular blog up for about 10 years
now and I've been blogging very haphazardly for most of that time. Maybe a post
every 6 months to a year. I had various websites before this, but this was my
first "blog".

This blog started as a place for me to "broadcast" my thoughts, but it's turned
into a parts bin/junk bin of sorts.  I tend to do a lot of barely structured
writing on topics I'm learning and things I've broken and fixed.

I think I'm just going to keep leaning into this "parts bin" paradigm and keep 
posting stuff here which may just be a quick note on what I'm doing or reading
on a particular day, but it's possible that it may be useful to other folks.
I do collect stats on posts and I can see what gets indexed the most so I can
see what weird things people are picking up on, but I'll likely just keep
posting my random posts with my [weird sense of humor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goon_Show_running_jokes).

I've not set up any sort of commenting here, but I can be found [on the
Fediverse]({{ site.author.fediverse }}) and I'd love to chat with you there. I
am also occasionally on other social networks but much more rarely.

I am also available via [email]({{ site.author.email }}) if you'd like to reach
me that way.
